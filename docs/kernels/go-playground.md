# Go Playground

### Go Playground kernel allows you to run `go` code without the go compiler installed on your local machine.

Every time you run a cell with code, it sends an HTTP request to the [GO Playground](https://play.golang.org/) website and parses the response data.

## Example usage

- Create a file with a `.gobook` extension
- Select the `Go Playground` kernel in the upper right corner of the screen
- Create a new `code cell` (press `+Code` button)
- Write some `go` code and run it!
