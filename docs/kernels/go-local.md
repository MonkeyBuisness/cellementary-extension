# Go Local

### Go Local kernel allows you to run `go` code using the go compiler installed on your local machine.

Every time you run a cell with code, it executes the

```console
$ go run
```
command on your local machine or the command specified in the `execution` metadata field of the executable cell.

## Download and install GO

Download and install Go on your machine with the steps described [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Example usage

- Create a file with a `.gobook` extension
- Select the `Go Local` kernel in the upper right corner of the screen
- Create a new `code cell` (press `+Code` button)
- Write some `go` code and run it!

## Have a nice GO!
