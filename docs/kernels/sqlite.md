# SQLite

### SQLite kernel allows you to run `SQL` scrips using the `sqlite` tool installed on your local machine.

Every time you run a cell with code, it executes the

```console
$ sqlite3 /path/to/sqlite.db [cell sql script]
```
commands on your local machine.

> If you are using Windows (7/8/10/11), please don't forget to add folder with `sqlite3` binaries to the system `PATH` environment variable. More info you find read in this [article](https://justjensen.co/setting-up-sqlite-on-windows-10/#installingsqlite3).
