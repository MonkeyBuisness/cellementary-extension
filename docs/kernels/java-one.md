# Java One

### Java One kernel allows you to run `java` code without the java compiler installed on your local machine.

Every time you run a cell with code, it sends an HTTP request to the [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/java/) website and parses the response data.

## Example usage

- Create a file with a `.javabook` extension
- Select the `Java One` kernel in the upper right corner of the screen
- Create a new `code cell` (press `+Code` button)
- Write some `java` code and run it!
